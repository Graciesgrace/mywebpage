This paper offers insights into the business-as-usual approach of credit rating agencies (CRAs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of adapting their methodologies and processes to reflect the severe and unpredictable nature of this health crisis, CRAs defers rating adjustments to pre-scheduled dates. This raises concerns about the timeliness of sovereign credit ratings.
